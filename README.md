# DDOS-attack-detection-mini-project

With an increase in the technological advancement, especially internet, there exists various kinds 
of network that attacks with distributed denial of service (DDOS) , which is the most dangerous
attack in field of network security. DDoS directly attacks on normal functional of critical
services of the various online applications, softwares and web apps. Systems under this DDoS
attack will always remain busy with the false requests (Bots) rather than providing the services
for legitimate users or actual user. These attacks are increasing day by day for legitimate users so
that users can not access the services and have become more and more sophisticated. So, it has to
become very difficult to detect these types of attacks and securing online services is too hard.
From these attacks,the main aspect of this attack is that it has to come with the little or no
advance warning and it could be easily exhaust communication for legitimate users or the
corresponding resources of victims in short span of time and that is challenging task. It will
become very difficult to detect and counter because these attacks are becoming very advance and
sophisticated with advanced technology and they are increasing day by day. Various types of
machine learning techniques are mainly used to detect the DDoS attacks. Random forest ,
Decision Tree, SVM algorithms are used for detection purposes. With training and testing the
detailed analysis of algorithms is performed and it is evaluated based on its accuracy.
